<h1>Turning Off Body and Header Checks for Internal Users</h1>

<p>
Since Postfix body and header checks do not have a way to
whitelist known good clients or IP addresses, administrators
generally configure a separate content filter to handle anything
more complicated than simple checks that they can confidently
apply to all messages. In many situations, however, you might
find it helpful to disable body and header checks for internal
users. Email from the outside is subject to the checks, but
internal messages do not use up processing and memory resources,
and you do not risk generating false-positives on messages from
your own users. This How-To describes one way to bypass header
and body checks for internal senders using the <tt
class="literal">receive_override_options</tt> feature that was
introduced in version 2.1 (and earlier snapshots) of Postfix. If
you are using a version prior to 2.1, the technique described
here will not work. This method also requires an additional IP
address for your Postfix system.
</p>

<p>
The idea is simple enough. Set up an additional <tt
class="command">smtpd</tt> instance for your internal users and
disable body and header checks for that instance only. We will
also disable body and header checks in the <tt
class="command">pickup</tt> daemon so that messages submitted
locally (on the same machine) will bypass content checking as
well. The second <tt class="command">smtpd</tt> instance listens
on a separate IP address. You should obtain an IP address from
your network administrator. If your system has multiple network
interfaces, then you may already have a second IP address to
use. If one interface is for an internal subnet, use its IP
address as the second one. If you don't have two or more network
cards, configure the second IP address as an alias on your
single network interface.
</p>

<h2>Adding an IP Address</h2>
<p>
If you have two interfaces, and you've identified the IP address
of the one you will use for internal users, you're all set. Skip
ahead to &quot;Configuring Postfix&quot; below. Otherwise, the
task of creating IP address aliases differs across various Unix
platforms. Check your system documentation to see how it is done
on your operating system. Most Unix platforms use the <tt
class="command">ifconfig</tt> command. You will probably find
the information you need in the <tt
class="command">ifconfig</tt> man page. For example, Linux and
HP-UX use an index number along with the name of the interface.
Configuring the second IP address 192.168.100.12 on Linux, looks
like the following:
</p>


<pre class="screen">
# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.100.12 netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre>

<p>
Other platforms, like FreeBSD and IRIX, use an <tt
class="command">alias</tt> command along with <tt
class="command">ifconfig</tt>, for example:
</p>


<pre class="screen">
# ifconfig ef0 alias 192.168.100.12 netmask 255.255.255.255
</pre>

<p>
You will want to configure your system so that the second IP
address is automatically set when your system boots up. See your
system documentation for the best way to do that. Also, if this
second interface is accessible from the Internet, make sure that
you configure your firewall so that external systems cannot
reach it. It's meant to be accesed by your internal users only.
</p>

<h2>Configuring Postfix</h2>
<p>
Now that you have a second IP address, you need to configure
Postfix to start a second instance of <tt
class="command">smtpd</tt> to handle requests over that address.
Before getting to that, however, you need to make sure that your
primary <tt class="command">smtpd</tt> does not gobble up all of
the IP addresses before your second instance gets a chance at
one. You can do that by editing the <tt
class="literal">inet_interfaces</tt> parameter in your <tt
class="filename">main.cf</tt> file. The parameter <tt
class="literal">inet_interfaces</tt> specifies which of your
interfaces Postfix should listen on, and by default, it's set to
&quot;all.&quot; You want to set it so that Postfix listens on
all IP addresses <b>except</b> the one we're configuring for
bypassing content checks. (We'll get Postfix listening on that
one next.)
</p>

<p>
Edit <tt class="filename">main.cf</tt> and find or add the <tt
class="literal">inet_interfaces</tt> parameter. Set it to your
main IP address (plus any additional IP addresses you may have
excluding the new one). In this example, the main IP address is
192.168.100.11, and it is the only IP address the original <tt
class="command">smtpd</tt> daemon should respond on.
</p>


<pre class="programlisting">
#
# main.cf
#
inet_interfaces = 192.168.100.11
</pre>

<p>
Next we'll create a new entry in <tt
class="filename">master.cf</tt> to add the additional instance
of <tt class="command">smtpd</tt>. This entry is identified by
the new IP address plus the <tt class="literal">smtp</tt> port,
which it should listen on. The entry includes a configuration
option to turn off body and header checks through the <tt
class="literal">receive_override_options</tt> parameter:
</p>


<pre class="screen">
#
# master.cf
#
192.168.100.12:smtp inet  n     -     n     -    - smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
</pre>

<p>
Note that the second line must start with whitespace to indicate
that it is a continuation of the previous line. There cannot be
any spaces between <tt
class="literal">receive_override_options</tt>, the equals sign,
and <tt class="literal">no_header_body_checks</tt>. If you
wanted to make other configuration changes to this instance, you
can add them in the same way. Otherwise, this instance will use
the same configuration from <tt class="filename">main.cf</tt>
other than any of the parameters you override here.
</p>

<p>
Also create a similar entry for the loopback address and add the
same <tt class="literal">no_header_body_checks</tt> feature to
the <tt class="command">pickup</tt> daemon so that all mail
submitted locally will also bypass the checks. The entries in
the <tt class="filename">master.cf</tt> file (including the
original <tt class="command">smtpd</tt> entry) should look like
the following:
</p>


<pre class="programlisting">
smtp                inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
192.168.100.12:smtp inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
127.0.0.1:smtp      inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
pickup              fifo  n     -     n    60     1   pickup
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
</pre>

<p>
You will have to stop and start Postfix after making these
changes. A reload is not enough when adding or changing
interfaces:
</p>


<pre class="screen">
# <b>postfix stop</b>
postfix/postfix-script: stopping the Postfix mail system
# <b>postfix start</b>
postfix/postfix-script: starting the Postfix mail system
</pre>

<p>
Be sure to check your log file to make sure there are no errors.
</p>

<p>
Tell your users to set their email clients to use 192.168.100.12
(or its hostname) as their SMTP server. Then all mail from your
local network or from the machine itself will skip body and
header checks configured in <tt class="filename">main.cf</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Here's a quick summary of the steps to bypass header and body
checks for internal users:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain or identify an IP address to use for internal email
relaying. Using either a second interface or IP aliasing
configure your system with the second IP address. Make sure that
the new address comes up when the system initializes.</li>
<li>Set the parameter <tt class="literal">inet_interfaces</tt> in
<tt class="filename">main.cf</tt> so that your original <tt
class="command">smtpd</tt> does not use your new internal IP
address.</li>
<li>Add entries to <tt class="filename">master.cf</tt> for the new
IP address and for the loopback IP. Include the configuration
option <tt class="literal">-o
receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks</tt> to skip body
and header checks. Also, add the same configuration override to
the <tt class="command">pickup</tt> daemon to skip the checks.</li>
<li>Stop and restart Postfix. Check your log file for any problems.</li>
</ol>
