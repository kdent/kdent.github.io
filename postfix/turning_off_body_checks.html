<h1>Turning Off Body and Header Checks for Internal Users</h1>
</div>

<p>
Since Postfix body and header checks do not have a way to whitelist known good
clients or IP addresses, administrators generally configure a separate content
filter to handle anything more complicated than simple checks that they can
confidently apply to all messages. In many situations, however, you might find
it helpful to disable body and header checks for internal users. Email from the
outside is subject to the checks, but internal messages do not use up
processing and memory resources, and you do not risk generating false-positives
on messages from your own users.  This How-To describes one way to bypass
header and body checks for internal senders using the
<code>receive_override_options</code> feature that was introduced in version 2.1
(and earlier snapshots) of Postfix. If you are using a version prior to 2.1,
the technique described here will not work. This method also requires an
additional IP address for your Postfix system.
</p>

<p>
The idea is simple enough. Set up an additional <code>smtpd</code> instance for
your internal users and disable body and header checks for that instance only.
We will also disable body and header checks in the <code>pickup</code> daemon
so that messages submitted locally (on the same machine) will bypass content
checking as well. The second <code>smtpd</code> instance listens on a separate
IP address. You should obtain an IP address from your network administrator. If
your system has multiple network interfaces, then you may already have a second
IP address to use. If one interface is for an internal subnet, use its IP
address as the second one. If you don't have two or more network cards,
configure the second IP address as an alias on your single network interface.
</p>

<h2>Adding an IP Address</h2>
<p>
If you have two interfaces, and you've identified the IP address of the one you
will use for internal users, you're all set. Skip ahead to &ldquo;Configuring
Postfix&rdquo; below. Otherwise, the task of creating IP address aliases differs
across various Unix platforms. Check your system documentation to see how it is
done on your operating system. Most Unix platforms use the
<code>ifconfig</code> command. You will probably find the information you need
in the <code>ifconfig</code> man page. For example, Linux and HP-UX use an
index number along with the name of the interface.  Configuring the second IP
address 192.168.100.12 on Linux, looks like the following:
</p>


<p class="code">
<code>
# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.100.12 netmask 255.255.255.0
</code>
</p>

<p>
Other platforms, like FreeBSD and IRIX, use an <code>alias</code> command along
with <code>ifconfig</code>, for example:
</p>


<p class="code">
<code># ifconfig ef0 alias 192.168.100.12 netmask 255.255.255.255</code>
</p>

<p>
You will want to configure your system so that the second IP address is
automatically set when your system boots up. See your system documentation for
the best way to do that. Also, if this second interface is accessible from the
Internet, make sure that you configure your firewall so that external systems
cannot reach it. It's meant to be accesed by your internal users only.
</p>

<h2>Configuring Postfix</h2>
<p>
Now that you have a second IP address, you need to configure Postfix to start a
second instance of <code>smtpd</code> to handle requests over that address.
Before getting to that, however, you need to make sure that your primary
<code>smtpd</code> does not gobble up all of the IP addresses before your
second instance gets a chance at one. You can do that by editing the
<code>inet_interfaces</code> parameter in your <code>main.cf</code> file. The
parameter <code>inet_interfaces</code> specifies which of your interfaces
Postfix should listen on, and by default, it's set to &lsquo;all&rsquo;. You
want to set it so that Postfix listens on all IP addresses <b>except</b> the
one we're configuring for bypassing content checks. (We'll get Postfix
listening on that one next.)
</p>

<p>
Edit <code>main.cf</code> and find or add the <code>inet_interfaces</code>
parameter. Set it to your main IP address (plus any additional IP addresses you
may have excluding the new one). In this example, the main IP address is
192.168.100.11, and it is the only IP address the original <code>smtpd</code>
daemon should respond on.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
#
# main.cf
#
inet_interfaces = 192.168.100.11
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Next we'll create a new entry in <code>master.cf</code> to add the additional
instance of <code>smtpd</code>. This entry is identified by the new IP address
plus the <code>smtp</code> port, which it should listen on. The entry includes
a configuration option to turn off body and header checks through the
<code>receive_override_options</code> parameter:
</p>


<p>
<pre class="code">
#
# master.cf
#
192.168.100.12:smtp inet  n     -     n     -    - smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Note that the second line must start with whitespace to indicate that it is a
continuation of the previous line. There cannot be any spaces between
<code>receive_override_options</code>, the equals sign, and
<code>no_header_body_checks</code>. If you wanted to make other configuration
changes to this instance, you can add them in the same way. Otherwise, this
instance will use the same configuration from <code>main.cf</code> other than
any of the parameters you override here.
</p>

<p>
Also create a similar entry for the loopback address and add the same
<code>no_header_body_checks</code> feature to the <code>pickup</code> daemon so
that all mail submitted locally will also bypass the checks. The entries in the
<code>master.cf</code> file (including the original <code>smtpd</code> entry)
should look like the following:
</p>


<p>
<pre class="code">
smtp                inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
192.168.100.12:smtp inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
127.0.0.1:smtp      inet  n     -     n     -     -   smtpd
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
pickup              fifo  n     -     n    60     1   pickup
   -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You will have to stop and start Postfix after making these changes. A reload is
not enough when adding or changing interfaces:
</p>


<p>
<pre class="code">
# <b>postfix stop</b>
postfix/postfix-script: stopping the Postfix mail system
# <b>postfix start</b>
postfix/postfix-script: starting the Postfix mail system
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Be sure to check your log file to make sure there are no errors.
</p>

<p>
Tell your users to set their email clients to use 192.168.100.12
(or its hostname) as their SMTP server. Then all mail from your
local network or from the machine itself will skip body and
header checks configured in <code>main.cf</code>.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Here's a quick summary of the steps to bypass header and body checks for
internal users:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Obtain or identify an IP address to use for internal email
relaying. Using either a second interface or IP aliasing
configure your system with the second IP address. Make sure that
the new address comes up when the system initializes.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the parameter <code>inet_interfaces</code> in <code>main.cf</code> so
that your original <code>smtpd</code> does not use your new internal IP
address.</p></li>

<li><p>Add entries to <code>master.cf</code> for the new IP address and for the
loopback IP. Include the configuration option <code>-o
receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks</code> to skip body and header
checks. Also, add the same configuration override to the <code>pickup</code>
daemon to skip the checks.</p></li>

<li><p>Stop and restart Postfix. Check your log file for any problems.</p></li>
</ol>
