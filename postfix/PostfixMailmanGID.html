title: Postfix and the Mailman GID

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<div class="abstract">
The following article is exerpted from
<span class="title">Postfix: The Definitive Guide</span>. This is a very
short section, but it addresses an issue that regularly trips people up.
</div>

<p class="first">
There is one slightly tricky aspect to get Postfix and Mailman
working together correctly. Mailman expects to be invoked by a
process running with a particular group id (GID). The GID it
expects is specified at the time the Mailman package is built. If
you are building the package yourself, make sure that you first
create an account and a group called <code>mailman</code>.
You should be able to use the normal administrative tools on your
system to create both the account and the group. When you are
finished, you should have an entry in
<code>/etc/passwd</code> that resembles the following:
</p>
<pre>mailman:*:26413:60003:Mailman List Manager:/home/mailman:/bin/sh
</pre>

<p>
And an entry in <code>/etc/group</code> like the following:
</p>
<pre>mailman:*:60003:</pre>

<p>
Make sure that the account <code>mailman</code> has the group
<code>mailman</code> as its primary group. In the examples above
<code>60003</code> specifies the <code>mailman</code> group and the
<code>mailman</code> account has that as its primary group.
</p>

<p>
When you run <code>configure</code> for Mailman, be sure that
you include the option
<code>--with-mail-gid=xxx</code>
where ‘xxx’ is the actual GID for the
<code>mailman</code> group that you created. According to the
examples above, you should execute <code>configure</code> using
60003 for the GID option.
</p><pre>$ ./configure --with-mail-gid=60003
</pre>
<p>
You may have additional options for <code>configure</code>
according to your environment. Be sure to read the Mailman
documentation for building the package.  If you have already built
your Mailman package and you did not specify the group, build it
again. If you didn't build your Mailman package, see the sidebar in
this chapter.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't build the Mailman package yourself (and don't have the
option of rebuilding it), there is no good way to find out which GID
it is expecting other than looking at what is reported in an error
message. If you have a mismatch between the group of the Postfix
process and the group that Mailman expects, you will receive a bounce
error message after you send an email message to a Mailman list.
Mailman also logs the error, which will look something like the
following:
</p>

<pre>
Failure to exec script. WANTED gid 12 GOT
gid 99 (Reconfigure to take 99?)
</pre>

<p>
In order to get Postfix to deliver the message to Mailman using the
correct GID, you have to set the permissions correctly on the Mailman
alias file. When Postfix makes a normal local delivery, it assumes the
identity of the recipient of the message. In the case of an alias,
Postfix assume the identity of the owner of the alias file. (Unless the
owner is <code>root</code>, in which case Postfix uses the identity
specified in its <code>default_privs</code> parameter.) Make sure that
the alias file is owned by the <code>mailman</code> user and that the
<code>mailman</code> user has the <code>mailman</code> GID as its
primary group.  Postfix will then use the <code>mailman</code> group
when it delivers a message to the Mailman system.
</p>

<p>
If you did not build your own Mailman package and therefore cannot
control the GID that it expects, you will have to accommodate Mailman
by getting Postfix to use the GID Mailman expects. Generate an error
message like the one above by first creating a list (see the steps in
this chapter) and then sending a message to it. You should receive a
bounce error email message (or you can check for the error in the
Mailman log). Note the GID Mailman reports that it wants
(<code>WANTED gid 12</code>). Change the primary group
of the <code>mailman</code> account to that group. Make sure
that the Mailman alias file is owned by the <code>mailman</code>
account.
