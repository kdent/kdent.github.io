<h2>Current</h2>

<p>
Currently, I am a lecturer in at Fordham University, teaching courses across
the computer science curriculum. Before becoming a teacher I was the head of AI
and Ethics at <a href="https://www.checkstep.com/">Checkstep</a> an early-stage
startup working on technology to detect and combat disinformation and toxic
content online. But I spent most of my career at the Palo Alto Research Center
(Xerox PARC). When I left PARC, I was the Research Director of AI at PARC. As a
research director, I was responsible for a portfolio of AI projects from
early-stage to mature technologies and made decisions about which efforts were
right for development and additional investment. I tracked the <img

width="360px" style="padding:15px"> latest and future trends in AI and ML. I
was also the co-founder and co-chair of the AI Ethics Committee at PARC.
</p>

<p>
Before I became the AI research director, I managed a research group called the
Machine Learning and Data Science area in the Interactions and Analytics Lab
(IAL). I first started as a Member of Research Staff in the Knowledge,
Language, and Interaction area, where we worked on improving humans'
relationship with the voluminous quantities of information available not only
in the world at large but even within our work and personal lives. My work at
PARC has drawn on many approaches such as text retrieval, natural language
processing, stochastic analysis, and visualization to help humans find and
understand the information relevant to them at a given point in time and within
a particular context.

<h2>Prior Work and the Early (Commercial) Internet</h2>
<p>
If you're curious about my experience during the early days of the commercial
internet, you can read on for much more information than you ever wanted to
know.
</p>

<h2>Hewlett-Packard</h2>
<p>
Before joining PARC, I worked at Hewlett-Packard as a Software
Architect. I first joined HP in July 1997 at a lab in Florham Park,
NJ. The lab was primarily focused on HP-UX kernel development and was
an interesting group that originally came from the Unix development
group at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. They had been spun out into a company
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_System_Laboratories">Unix
System Labs</a> several years before I joined them.  That company was later
acquired by Novell, which in turn sold the majority of it to SCO and
the rest to HP. I ended up with the HP group. It was very useful and
instructive to be working with serious kernel developers who had years
of programming experience and knew so much about early Unix days.
</p>

<p>
By the time I joined the group, they were fully integrated into HP. I
was brought on because of experience I had with Internet technologies
as they were starting Internet and e-commerce initiatives. We created
some of the first full-featured e-commerce solutions in partnership
with American Express, AT&amp;T, and early Internet start-ups like
Open Market and iCat. The company iCat lasted for about ten minutes I
think. Open Market had a longer run. They are the ones who created
FastCGI and laughably had the patent for online shopping carts.
Fortunately they never tried to assert their claim (that I know of).
A few years later the lab was shut down by HP. Some people took
jobs with HP and moved to other sites (mostly Ft. Collins, CO), but many
had to find work elsewhere. I was lucky enough to have started working
with a group in California and was able to continue with HP as a
remote teleworker from my home in New York. Eventually I made the move
to California where I am now. I ended up working for HP for more than
13 years.
</p>

<p>
While at HP I worked quite a bit with HP's Virtual Vault, which is a highly
secure version of Unix based on the Orange Book, which was part of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series">Rainbow Series</a>
describing security controls from the Department of Defense. The VirtualVault
system was basically what the standard calls a CMW (compartmentalized mode
workstation). <a
href="http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux/index.shtml">SELinux</a> and <a
href="http://www.trustedbsd.org/">TrustedBSD</a> are current projects that
follow some of the same approaches.  This security work is what led me to the
email software Postfix. While I was working on porting various applications to
the environment, IBM made their announcement and released Secure Mailer
(actually Postfix). Naturally, it caught my eye, and I started replacing
Sendmail on all of my systems. Later, I wrote an article for SysAdmin magazine
and eventually a book on Postfix.
</p>

<p>
I ended up working for HP even though I came from an IBM family. My father,
brother, uncles, aunts, and both grandfathers worked for IBM, and I have a
cousin who continues there now. I like to say my blood runs blue. People have
asked if there was any friction within the family since I worked at HP.  In
fact my father was just relieved that I was starting a 'regular' job and was
thrilled. My first job out of college was working on a lobster boat and that
shook him a bit. I also did a lot of freelancing before settling in at HP.
Actually, I had already tried a regular job a while back doing IT at a
brokerage firm. I didn't care for it.
</p>

<h2>Early ISP</h2>
<p>
The previous Internet experience that led me to the job with HP came
from working with a very early ISP. The company was run by a guy who
had worked with early game developers like Atari, and he knew Unix
inside and out, and could pound out code in his sleep. His company
predated widespread Internet adoption and was a BBS with a rather
large membership. He started to provide Internet access to members and
later started selling dial-up accounts. I worked with him for a few years
and then started my own web hosting business. I had seen that the web
would be popular and even sent out marketing letters explaining to
people that just as a fax machine is commonplace now when nobody had
them several years earlier, soon people would ask matter-of-factly for
your website address. Unfortunately being correct but early is the
same as being wrong, so I didn't profit in any big way as many early
Internet start-ups did. As a matter of fact, after I struggled with
designing the architecture for hosting multiple web sites and building
tools to manage them, it started to get boring, which is when I went
to work for HP and gave up on my own business (too soon as it turned
out). I even offered geographically disparate, redundant sites
maintaining and mirroring servers in New York and Florida, but
hardly anybody had a mission critical web presence at the time, so
nobody cared.

<h2>A Little IBM PC History</h2>
<p>
I had an early exposure to computers considering my age because my father
worked for IBM. As a matter of fact, he worked on the original IBM PC project
as part of the team that did the initial study to consider the feasibility of
<img src="/images/cathedral_book.jpg" align="left" alt="Cathedral Book Photo"
  style="padding:15px" width="320px">
such a product. It was his team that recommended to IBM that the project be
handled as if it were a separate entity from the normal IBM processes. There is
an interesting historical footnote that not many people probably know.  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Don_Estridge">Don Estridge</a> who
was in charge of the project gave a book to all of the team members called
<cite>Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction</cite> by David Macaulay. I have
my father's copy and a letter from Mr. Estridge.  I doubt that Eric Raymond
could have known about the book when he wrote "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral
and the Bazaar</a>." If nothing else Raymond has a remarkable knack for titling
papers and this one was right on in more ways than he probably knew. On the
other hand, there is some irony in the fact that the PC project was a
significant break from the normal IBM approach and might have resembled the
bazaar more than the cathedral from the normal IBM perspective.
</p>

<p>
My father's work gave me some early exposure to computers that most
people my age did not have. Even before the PC came out, we had a mini
computer in our house. I'm not sure exactly what kind of computer it
was but I believe it was a knock-off of one of the DEC machines. I
learned to write some simple BASIC programs on that system. After IBM
started manufacturing the PC, my father brought home different models
on loan that I got to play around with until they went back.
</p>

<h2>First Exposure to Computers</h2>
<p>
Even before the DEC knock-off, we had another family friend who also
worked for IBM who made his own computer from various parts. I don't
know what he used for a processor, but it had a cassette player for
storage and speakers and various buttons for input. It had some crude
games and did math and some other things. We thought it was quite cool
at the time. I might have been inspired by that (I can't remember
now), but in the fifth grade, I made a "computer" for a science
project. Of course, it wasn't a computer at all but it did simple
arithmetic. With help from my father, I drilled holes in a board to
hold some push-button switches and lights arranged in rows. Each row
was labeled with a value and the switches each had their own values
too. If you held down the right combination of switches to add up to
the correct sum for that row, the light would illuminate. It was kind
of goofy, but I got to use a soldering iron and think about how
computers might actually work. If I had painted it, it
could have been a panel right out of an early Star Trek set.
</p>

<p>
So, I like to say that I grew up with computers, but I never expected
to make my living with them when I was younger. As a matter of fact, I
studied English literature in college and got a degree in film all the
while starting a career in computers without really thinking about it.
In 2002, I decided to make myself legitimate and went back to school
to get a masters degree in computer science.
