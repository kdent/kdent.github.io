<h1>Hello.</h1>

<p>
Welcome to my personal website. I am lecturer at <a
href="https://www.fordham.edu/">Fordham
University</a> in the <a
href="https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/">Computer
and Information Sciences</a> department.  Prior to
Fordham, I was the <b>Research Director</b> for AI at the <a
href="https://www.parc.com/">Palo Alto Research Center</a> (Xerox PARC) where I
worked from 2008 to April 2021.

<p>
I teach courses across the computer science curriculum, but my professional
work focuses on machine learning, NLP, and dialog systems. I also write a
weekly newsletter called <a href="https://kyledent.substack.com/">AI
Matters</a>, which helps readers decipher artificial intelligence, understand
who it affects and the ways it might or might not change our world. You can
