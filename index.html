<h1>Hello.</h1>

<p>
Welcome to my personal website. I am an AI/ML research engineer and currently
the head of AI Ethics at <a href="https://www.checkstep.com/">CheckStep</a>
building technology to combat disinformation and toxic content online. Prior to
CheckStep, I was the <b>Research Director</b> for AI at the <a
href="https://www.parc.com/">Palo Alto Research Center</a> (Xerox PARC) where I
worked from May 2008 to April 2021. Most of my technical work has been focused
on NLP and dialog systems.  </p>

<p>
I want to support efforts to develop the platforms, structures, organizations,
and practices to allow for the dissemination of quality information while
respecting free expression leading to healthy and informed discourse around the
world.
