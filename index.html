<p>
Welcome to my personal website. I am an AI/ML research engineer and currently
the <b>Research Director</b> for AI at the <a href="https://www.parc.com/">Palo
Alto Research Center</a> (Xerox PARC) where I have been working since May 2008.
Most of my technical work has been focused on NLP and dialog systems.
</p>
<p>
I am also involved in <b>AI Ethics</b> and <b>combating misinformation</b> and
hate speech online. My interest is actually to support efforts to develop the
platforms, structures, organizations, and practices to allow for the
dissemination of quality information respecting free expression leading to
healthy and informed discourse around the world.
