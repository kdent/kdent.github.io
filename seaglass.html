Originally I used the seaglass.com domain for a web hosting company I started
in the 1990's. I've had lots of requests for the name, but I don't want to give
it up since I've been using it for my email address for so long.

Why seaglass.com? I grew up in Florida and spent a fair amount of time
exploring the beach. We found sand dollars and lots of shells that we  mostly
left alone and sea glass that we collected and took home. It's a trick to spot
it. My mother was really good at it and has quite a collection. I obtained the
domain name in June of 1996 when I started a web hosting company called
SeaGlass Technologies, Inc. At the time, there were several software companies

more prominent ones was <a

started by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Kahn"> Phillipe
Kahn</a> (of Borland fame). Caught up in the latest naming fashion, I revived a
name and the logo my father had used for a company he ran in the 1970's called
Sea Glass Office Services, which pre-dated widespread use of personal
computers. He provided mailing list (physical mail) and data analysis services
to small businesses.
