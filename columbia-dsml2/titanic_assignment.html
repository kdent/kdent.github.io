<h1>Assignment: Predicting Passenger Survival on the Titanic</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will try out your new skills with creating classifiers. You'll use Scikit-Learn's API to create a model that can make predictions on the Titanic dataset.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>
Download the <code><a href="data/titanic.csv">titanic.csv</a></code> file and upload it to your data files directory on Google Drive.
</li>

<li>
Start a new Colab notebook and load the data into a Pandas dataframe.
</li>

<li>
Decide on an appropriate model to use for your classifier and load it from Scikit-Learn.
</li>

<li>
Divide your data into a training and test set.
</li>

<li>
Use your training data to train your model.
</li>

<li>
Use your test set to test your model
</li>

<li>
Report on how well your model performs.
</li>

<p>
You can decide for yourself what model to use. You can also decide which features to include for training. You might use only the numeric features to start with. If you then want to challenge yourself more, do some feature engineering on categorical features and bring those into your model as well.
</p>

<p>
You will also have to decide what to do about missing values. Again, you might start by simply dropping samples with missing data. After you get your model working, you can try imputing values for the missing ones. See if that improves your results or not.
