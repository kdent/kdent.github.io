<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">
https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive</a> From there create a new folder
called "columbia-ml-data", and make it your current directory.</li>

<li>Download the file <code>iris.csv</code> to your machine and then upload it
to the <code>columbia-ml-data</code> directory you just created on your Google
drive.</li>

<li>Next, go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">
