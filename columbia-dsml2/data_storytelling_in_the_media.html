<h1>Data Storytelling in the Media</h1>
Find a news article that uses data visualizations to help tell its story. You
may choose from one of these media organizations:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/graphics" target="_blank">The New York Times Graphics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-visualisation" target="_blank">The Guardian Data visualizations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/andrew-van-dam/" target="_blank">Andrew Van Dam, Columnist at The Washington Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot" target="_blank">The Upshot at The New York Times</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a></li>
</ul>

Or you can select any appropriate site that you find. Read the article to understand the story and analyze the data presented in the story.

Prepare a very brief presentation (you can use slides but that's not necessary)
to summarize the article for the rest of us and how the story uses data to
communicate the main points. Think about the following questions for your
presentation:

<ol>
<li>What is the article trying to communicate?</li>
<li>How does it use dataviz to support that goal?</li>
<li>Where did their data come from?</li>
<li>Do you think the visualizations are effective at communicating the point of the article? In what ways is data used effectively or in what ways does it fall short?</li>
</ol>
