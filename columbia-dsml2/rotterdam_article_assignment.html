<h1>Assignment: Reading "Inside the Suspicion Machine"</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will have to think about how algorithmic decision making is used to make decisions about real people and their lives. You will also be asked to infer technical details about the machine learning models discussed in the article.</p>

<hr>

<p>Read the article Inside the Suspicion Machine in Wired Magazine. After reading the article, you can pair up or go into your groups to discuss it. You can comment on the article in any way that you like, but also think about these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What historical data was used to train the machine learning models?</li>
<li>What features/variables were used to train the model? How many features/variables were included in the model?</li>
<li>What specifically does the algorithm produce?</li>
<li>It's not stated directly in the text, but what type of model do you think Accenture used?</li>
<li>How well does the machine learning model perform? The article doesn't give a score of any kind, but it does hint at a performance metric.</li>
<li>We've discussed in class the use of proxy variables. Did Accenture use any proxy variables as training data? If so, what proxies did they use for what attributes?</li>
<li>How was Wired Magazine able to get information to investigate this story?</li>
<li>How do you view the traits 'vulnerable' and 'suspicious'? How does the algorithm view them?</li>
<li>Do you think someone who makes a mistake on a form is guilty of fraud? Does the algorithm?</li>
<li>The promise of automated decision making is to bring accuracy and neutrality to an area that is historically prone to biases. This algorithm did not achieve that promise, but do you think there is a way to achieve it?</li>
</ul>
